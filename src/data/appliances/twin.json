  "description": "All our performed experiences and imagined times (past or future) are inextricably linked to the objects we design to be around us in the environments we build. Twin is part of the Appliance Series. The work in this series, the objects I made them from and their ghosts, all attest to my desires, taste, and status. They are indicators of the personal and the cultural. These works attempt to further blur the indistinctions between art exhibition, commercial display and domestic organization. Their character is adopted from marketable design and their purpose is borrowed from ‘art.’ Because many of these works are neither traditional sculpture nor functional appliances – because many of these works impel tenuous connections with the familiar and incomplete recognitions – they situate comfortably in a place best associated with memory.",
