  "description": "The sounds that emanate from Segue are pulled mostly from early family-based television shows. These sounds were used to transition scenes and often imply the passing of time. This work addresses how we construct memory and how objects retain history. This work was rethought, reworked and added to the group called Coping Mechanisms.  Segue maintains a bank of short sound recordings taken from ’50s and ’60s television sitcoms and movies. It has recently been redesigned to respond every time Donald Trump posts a Tweet. Each sound-bite helps transition the audience from one ego-driven outburst to the next helping to normalize and expedite every painful step toward the loss of our Democracy",
