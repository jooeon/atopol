  "description": "This installation was part of ‘Playground 2018’ and it occupied what was a chemistry lab in a former High School in Medina, NY. It employed a variety of means to conjure an imagined past based on a researched history. A net dragged through the space of my own religious and educational indoctrination yielded the installation components and they formed a new consequence for this specific classroom, the building’s function and the people that once experienced them.",
