  "description": "This work, A Variable Account, employs a variety of means (UHF signals, audio, photographic, built and altered) to represent an imagined past for a singular office space, the space’s function and the people who occupied it. The viewer is presented with mediated versions of an office area and subsequently a ‘real’ version in which furniture is distorted to imply a space that is both permeable and subject to change.    This installation was one of 18 events/installations in The City is Asleep and Dreaming. The site-specific works were installed in a defunct bank and designed to help develop a public dialogue about the transitioning identity of the city of Rochester New York and provoke a re-imagination of what public space is and what it could be.",
