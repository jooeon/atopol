  "description": "Digital clock design commonly incorporates a blink, signaling a disturbance in electricity and a possible interruption of our day. Answering machines and voice mail serve to accommodate inconsistencies in our presence. These objects inform us of cessations to our expected privileges. The work is ongoing and expands the number of clocks in each subsequent presentation; this video presents two iterations â€“ the latter including more clocks than the former. The collection and assembly began just prior to the pandemic and came to bear added significance during it when, for many, interruption and absence came to the forefront while time seemed to unfold in unsettling ways.",
