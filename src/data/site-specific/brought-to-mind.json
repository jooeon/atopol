  "description": "The installation first presents the visitor with several live televisions having the image of a seemingly normal red leather chair on them. A few minutes into the installation the viewer comes to an Mp3 player and an upside-down camera with a UHF transmitter on a tripod pointed to a 1/3 scale chair inverted and hanging on the ceiling. The viewer is pressed to reconsider their spatial and temporal relationship with an object that would otherwise remain fixed via memory in its common circumstance – the one first perceived on the televisions – a mediated one, – a normal chair in a normal space.",
