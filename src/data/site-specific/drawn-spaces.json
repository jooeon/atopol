  "description": "This video was first installed as a projection the second story gantry opening of a barn-shaped exhibition space (2 Loud Cows Gallery, Spencerport, NY).  More than an animation, Drawn Spaces is intended to convey a single subject drawn hundreds of times. The repetitious act is an attempt to remember and understand the subject. That subject morphs momentarily to the space of the exhibition and to my Uncle Sammy’s garage – and then back again. The main building in the projection was one my father built; it survived floods that twice whisked away the larger main building on our family property. It, like my Uncle Sammy’s garage, was my father’s retreat – a marginal place in geographical terms but otherwise central to his identity, and in turn, mine.",
