  "description": "Rochester Contemporary, Sibley Building Annex Gallery  This installation was constructed for Rochester Contemporary; an annexed exhibition site at the Sibley Building downtown Rochester New York. The commercial aesthetic referenced here uses technology that supported fantasies of increased domestic leisure. In these contexts the character of the fabricated components is adopted from marketable design and their purpose is borrowed from ‘art.’ The text, labels and signage frame the objects and prompt a closer examination. Traces of ‘making’ become evident and the objects then become more clearly fabricated by hand. This then encourages the viewer to contemplate relationships between function and form, the mass produced and the crafted, the mundane and the unique.",
