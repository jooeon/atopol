  "description": "This installation involves objects that are functional, objects that are art (or materials for the making of art), and many that posture themselves tenuously between both categories. Some are altered, some are not – some are painted to meld into the middle gray of the gallery walls. The common visual characteristics the works share with everyday objects as well as their dioramic arrangement are intended to establish an initial degree of viability with the viewer. A violation of the expected will occur upon closer scrutiny of the individual installation components and the lines between that which constructs the work and the work itself will become as blurred for the viewer as for the maker. This idea’s iteration was installed at the Memorial Art Gallery in Rochester, NY. in 2006."
