  "description": "Cairns are traditionally made of a mound of rough stones built as a memorial or property or landmark. The bowling ball cairns in Markers for Tippy are arranged in pyramids that mimic the common organization of bowling pins and deny the balls’ typical dynamic function. The pattern established by the piles is defied by the partially sunken cairn and the ball that appears to deny gravity. I associate bowling to my blue-collar background; my father was an avid and skilled bowler. His nickname was Tippy.",
