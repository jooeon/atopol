  "description": "Memorial Art Gallery, Rochester, NY  Originally conceived by sound artist and pianist David Tudor in 1973, “Rainforest IV” is a sonic environment made of uniquely designed sculptural objects suspended in space and fitted with electric transducers, turning them into resonant sound objects. The earliest versions of involved Merce Cunningham’s dance company and the installation contributions of Andy Warhol. This version of “Rainforest IV,” was created by the Eastman Audio Research Studio (EARS) at the Eastman School of Music, under the direction of Oliver Schneller, with exhibition design from Allen Topolski. In this rendition dancers Missy Pfohl Smith, Anne Harris Wilcox, and Rose Pasquarello Beauchamp improvised a performance to which the musicians sonically responded.
