  "description": "This is the second iteration of (re)collecting/(re)constructing installed at the Buffalo Art Studio in 2013  The single childhood memory of my grandfather, the one vestige of a brief seemingly inconsequential experience, it turns out, was actually a recollection I had constructed from a photograph.  (re)collecting / (re)constructing addresses the means by which we fabricate memory and the fruitless pursuit of that which can not be regained. The mechanism for recollection becomes increasingly inadequate when put to use repeatedly and the likelihood of its contamination with ‘inaccuracy’ increases with its distance from the inceptive moment. Loss [death] is the immutable genuine nature of the photographic image (Barthes) — for me this work is about the loss of loss — the dispossession of the last vestige of that which had encompassed my relationship with a portion of my past. Each photographic image represents an attempt at the recollection of one aspect of an imagined memory; each one is close to accurate/ each one is far from accurate. The central scrim becomes an arena of for the fabrication of a distinct memory – the place where a coalescence of fluid components is undertaken again and again."
