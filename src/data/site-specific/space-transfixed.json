  "description": "We revel in our past and press into our future; we delight in the engagements of travel and yearn for the comforts of home. We put furniture outside and plants in our living room. We live tethered to dichotomies.  This work is an encapsulated portrait of a specific place framed by Magritte’s Time Transfixed – a work that punctures realism with a coalescence of things mildly related and a space, plausible but not possible. The video portion of the work combines digital footage and found 8mm film footage – the former taken recently at the sites of the latter*.  Space Transfixed, a site-specific work, was part of Inside/Out (248 East Avenue) a group exhibition curated by Colleen Buzzard and part of Current Scene, Rochester, NY’s biennial.  *Home movies made between 1969 and 1985.
