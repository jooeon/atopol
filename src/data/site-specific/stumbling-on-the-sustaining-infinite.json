  "description": "Actors, rabbits, mulch, ink-jet prints and found and altered objects.  Stumbling on the Sustaining Infinite, employs a variety of means to represent an imagined past and its consequence for a specific building, the building’s function and the people who once occupied it. Making its history permeable, I locate my own religious indoctrination within that imagined scenario most pointedly around questions of the spiritual’s relationship to matter and the body, the real to the unreal, and the eternal to the temporal. “Stumbling on the Sustaining Infinite” was part of Compartmented a multimedia site-specific event co-curated by Evelyne Leblanc-Roberge & Missy Pfohl Smith"
