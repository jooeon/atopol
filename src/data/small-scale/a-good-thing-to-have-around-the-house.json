  "description": "From a perspective behind the handle, the viewer can see what appears to be a black and white version of the gallery floor on which they and the object stand. In reality, what is visible is a large black and white ink-jet print of a photograph of the gallery floor that was taken before the exhibition and installed inside the object’s main body. The work asserts itself as an instrument where function is forfeited to (a false) visual mediation which also appears to be its primary function."
