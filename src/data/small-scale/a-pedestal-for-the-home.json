  "description": "In bearing no object, the works in the Pedestal Series speak to absence and simultaneously point to the context/space of the gallery. They point attention to the crossovers between means of display and methods of storage. Through them I explore and experience the push of the professional and the pull of the domestic. This pedestal has a ‘cozy’ that mimics appliance cozies from the 60s and 70s and while also alluding to the alter cloths and vestments I recall from my youth’s weekly church visits."
