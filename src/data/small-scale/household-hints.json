  "description": "Found materials with audio track The sound track of Household Hints instructs homeowners in the repair of broken appliances and points to loss and objects that maintain only a history of function. The recorded segments were taken from an appliance repair help-line. The doily indicates the place where something, now absent, once rested. The Sound Cabinet Series addresses how objects retain history and how we construct memory."
