  "description": "Several years ago, soon after my father died, I started striking deals with what wasn’t even promised me – negotiating with what I had previously assumed – ‘all the time in the world.’ More recently, these ongoing arbitrations have needed serious restructuring. Where I once imagined a legacy of some sort for the world of the future, I am now concerned with the existence of any future world at all. Still, in the face of this, I look inward to my past and outward to my family. Irrespective of any particular physical state, this contraption is designed to keep me focused on what is important.",
