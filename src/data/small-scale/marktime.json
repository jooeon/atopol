  "description": "The looped audio in this work was found among the belongings of the woman who raised my mother; when Aunt Anna died, I found the tape in a cassette recorder. It marks the time when she was first given the appliance and my father demonstrated its function by recording her singing a Ukrainian hymn. Their passing exchange became a poignant document sustained through a now obsolete mechanism.  Audio Player"
