  "description": "The Sound Cabinet Series addresses how we construct memory and how objects retain history. The sound track in R-Kive juxtaposes an found audio journal entry noting the induction of an individual into the army with an adolescent’s fictional documentary of war and a musical sound track from the period; ironically, all clips were found on the same reel. ‘Authenticity’ and invention intersect again in the images on top of the cabinet where personal family pictures are augmented with digitally fabricated ‘appliances.’",
