  "description": "All the works in this series employ painted images on old projection screens that are visually obstructed by objects or mechanisms appertained to them in some way. This work teeters a floor-lamp on a stand inches away from the painted projection screen; electronics make the light occasionally flicker off enabling the viewer to realize that the ‘blow-out’ is painted as well as actual. These works are attempts to relate imagery and representation to objects and function along a delicate line of comprehension – a line like the remaining one connecting us to things we used to need – things that we have almost forgotten.  The video seen here was taken at Hallwalls in Buffalo NY during the ‘Amid/In WNY’ exhibition in 2015.",
