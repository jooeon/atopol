  "description": "The painting components in this series of works are mostly connected to objects related to former needs. This work relates a painting of a clothes iron and a fabricated tool made of Mangle-Iron parts along a delicate line of comprehension – a line like the remaining one connecting us to things we used to need – things that we have almost forgotten."
