  "description": "The works in this category employ painted images on old projection screens that are visually obstructed by objects or mechanisms appertained to them in some way. They are attempts to relate imagery and representation to objects and function along a delicate line of comprehension – a line like the remaining one connecting us to things we used to need – things that we have almost forgotten."
