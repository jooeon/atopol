  "description": "The painting component of this work shows the model electric lawnmower I used as a teenager. The objects partially obstructing the view of it connects to a personal shift in aesthetic preferences that also aligns with a changing cultural aesthetic. This work attempts to relate imagery and representation to objects and function along a delicate line of comprehension – a line like the remaining one connecting us to things we used to need – things that we have almost forgotten.",
