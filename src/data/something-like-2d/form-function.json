  "description": "We want our rest to be productive and our productivity to be restful. We summon extensions of ourselves – tools of our productivity and organization – with expectations that they will spare us from drudgery or supplement our repose. These works represent recent contemplations of functional objects (and their spaces and interiors) with which I align form/function with leisure/labor.  The Form/Function drawings are documents of a process toggled between digital approaches/prints and analog methods in an attempt to take advantage of each. There are (seemingly) pinned to domestic surface materials that serve as a framing devices and a reference to the space where the objects may have been originally been employed in the home."
