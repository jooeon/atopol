  "description": "This work in the Indidem Series is spackled and painted to the wall on its two sides. All the works in the Indidem Series employ the repetition of alternating drawing processes – erasing and mark-making, drawing and redrawing, adding and subtracting – the same image or a similar representation again and again. The process mimics the act of recall – one that relies on and accumulates residual information.",
