  "description": "This intaglio print is an examination of an inside/outside relationship – an electric ‘massager’ from the 1950s whose external design necessitated significant compromise to the internal workings so as to accommodate the human body.  I emphasize the exterior with a chine collé process to the surface of the print and the interior with elaborate mark-making akin to the complexity of the mechanism. ",
