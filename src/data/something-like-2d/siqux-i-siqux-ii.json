  "description": "These intaglio prints are examinations of an inside/outside relationship – an electric drill whose external design necessitated significant compromise to the internal workings so as to accommodate the human body.  In Siqux I and II, I emphasize the exterior with a chine collé process to the surface of the print and the interior with elaborate mark-making akin to the complexity of the mechanism. "
